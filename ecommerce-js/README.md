# React E-Commerce (Demo)

This is a simple demo e-commerce front-end built with React + Vite.

Features:
- React Router v6 routes for pages
- Context API for Products, Auth (mock), and Cart
- Sample products JSON
- Responsive, minimal CSS

Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
cd ecommerce-js
npm install
```

2. Run dev server

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open the URL shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes

- Auth is mocked — login/signup simply set a demo user.
- No backend; data comes from `src/data/products.json`.
- Images use Unsplash placeholder URLs.

Feel free to customize components, add a backend, or replace styles with Tailwind.
